#Introduction
TODO: Give a short introduction of your project. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project. 

This project is aimed to perform simulations of the magnetic behavior of single domain magnetic nanoparticles for magnetic particle imaging.
It includes:
A basic library set for often used shortcuts
A serialization framework like cereal (http://uscilab.github.io/cereal/) although with slightly different rules and not all features; It has adapters to use cereals archive formats 


#Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:

1.	Installation process
Create a branche and clone it in a folder C:\Path\to\Repo\
Also download/clone pcg, boost, eigen & cereal and but in the folder C:\Path\Extern\ or change all include paths within the project to the correct folders.
Also put the MATLAB bin and includes in the Folder C:\Path\Extern\
If you want to run the programm make sure C:\Program Files\Matlab\<MATLABVERSION>\bin\win64 is part of the PATH variable

2.	Software dependencies
Needs MATLAB 

3.	Latest releases
No official release yet, still under development


4.	API references

#Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests. 

#Contribute
TODO: Explain how other users and developers can contribute to make your code better. 

Create your own branch und create push requests.
